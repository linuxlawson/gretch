If any problems with display:  

tr (translate) was used for deleting characters in output,  
mostly parenthesis ( ), brackets [ ], and single quotes ' '.  

The cut command was also used to delete certain characters from output.  

In printf, %-5s is used for spacing between printf and output.   
Adjust accordingly if need be.

This can run everytime you open your terminal by placing the path (or alias) to program at the end of the .bashrc file.
